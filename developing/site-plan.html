      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wanted an app but you don’t know anyone who knows how to build one? This website can help you. On this website you can find people who can make apps. You just send them what you want and they’ll tell you what they can do. You can learn about what they have created in the past and you can see what they usually charge. Then you just send them what you want and they give you a price for the job and if you like they’ll do the job and send it to you.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is basicly anyone. It's anyone who has an idea for an app but needs help making it. This website would also be for app developers so that they have a site that they can get work from.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Name: Nicholas Elliott
        I've coded for a couple of years now and am able to code on a computer decently well.
        I am now trying to learn to code apps and get better at it but I am still not very good at it.
        I tend to be pretty cheep for makeing the apps since I am not the best at making the apps and they 
        don't always turn out the best but I am trying to practice so I will do my best and learn from what I do.
        I would be happy to help anyone if you would like to contact me at my eamil.
